HOW TO PLAY:

Wordle is a popular word guessing game. The program will select at random from the word bank a five letter word.
The goal is to correctly guess the five letter word in 6 guesses or less. 

If the user guess has letters that are contained in the word, the scoreboard will show the letters. 
If the letters are lowercase, the letter is in the word but not in the correct position. 
Uppercase letters are in the correct position. 

If the word is not guessed after 6 rounds, the word will be displayed.
